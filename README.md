Intership Task @ProdigyInfoTech

I'm thrilled to share my accomplishment on a recent internship task at Prodigy InfoTech . 

I tackled Task 1, which involved creating an interactive navigation menu that not only enhances user experience but also adds a touch of style to the website.‚ú® 

TASK_1:
"Create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering iver a menu item. The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages. Use HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and javascript to add background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over."

Task Completion: 

üîçInteractive Navigation menu Features: 

1. Fixed Position : The menu stays put at the top, ensuring easy navigation. 
2. Scroll Effects : Watch the transformation as you scroll!
3. Hover Styles : Experience a subtle style shift when hovering over each menu item, adding a delightful touch of interactivity. 

üë®‚Äçüíª Knowledge Gained : 

This task was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my understanding of front-end development. ‚ú® 
I learned more about creating navigation menus, applying scroll effects, and using JavaScript to add that extra layer of interactivity.
